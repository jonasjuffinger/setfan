This program allows to easily set the fan speed with `setfan speed`.
Speed can be from 0 (off) to 7 (max) and `auto`.
 
If the speed is set to 0, the CPU temperature is monitored and the fan speed is set to auto if temperture exceeds 70Â° for 10 seconds.

Requires libsensors

Hint: Use sticky bit to automatically run as root
